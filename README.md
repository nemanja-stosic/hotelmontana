# Features

<h3>Hotel Montana</h3>

We can book a guest at the hotel. We need to state his / her name, check-in and check-out dates, as well as how many adults will be staying in the hotel room and how many children, and finally we need to choose which room the guest will use.

If necessary, we can contact the manager by sending a message.

# Technologies 

<h3>Frontend</h3>

For the frontend I used an HTML template (copyright mentioned above) and the reason why I decided to use an HTML template is that I wanted to focus more on backend development (Java, Spring, MySQL), but I also wanted to have a nice view.
Also, this was an opportunity to see what a real life project looks like and how to effectively build a frontend, which was very helpful because I learned a lot of new things.
 
I changed HTML code into JSP syntax, significantly changed the original code, and wrote a little CSS and javascript as well. Also, I made use of spring JSP tag libraries and the expression language (EL).

<h3>Backend</h3>

For background development, I used Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate. The design patterns used to develop this application are the Data Access Object (DAO) which provides an abstract interface for the MySQL database, the factory design pattern that forwards us objects of a given type, and the Model View Controller design pattern (MVC).

For project management I used Maven and for database I used MySQL.

# Conclusion

The main goal of this project was to improve and perfect my Spring Boot skills. I was given the opportunity to work with all kinds of situations involving HTTP methods such as POST + GET + Redirect to get the right result, GET + POST, etc. I also learned a good approach for organizing frontend code for JSP, CSS, and JavaScript.
