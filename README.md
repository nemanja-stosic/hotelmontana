<h3>Frontend</h3>
For the frontend I used an HTML template (copyright mentioned above) and the reason why I decided to use an HTML template is that I wanted to focus more on backend development (Java, Spring, MySQL), but I also wanted to have a nice view.
Also, this was an opportunity to see what a real life project looks like and how to effectively build a frontend, which was very helpful because I learned a lot of new things.
 
I significantly changed html code into jsp syntax, I wrote a little CSS and javascript as well. Also, I made use of spring jsp tag libraries.
